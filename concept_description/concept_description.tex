\chapter{Concept Description}
The project's goal is the construction of a platform that facilitates the communication and authorization aspects of remote controlling a device over the internet.
Agents connect to the platform through which their sensory information, available commands and functions are made available to authorized users.
Use of the platform increases the possible simultaneous audience of a connected agent, as users do not have to query the agent directly for the information. 
Agents actively query the platform to obtain commands from users.
In the same manner, users must actively query the platform to obtain new information from or about the agents.
See Figure \ref{fig:system-overview} for an illustration of how the communication between the platform and connected entities.

%TODO: flesh out the concept description.
% I think it's a description of the concept
% where "the concept" is what we are doing/trying to do/have done/want to do/the project
