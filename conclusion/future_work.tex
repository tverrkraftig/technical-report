This section details some possible avenues for future work on this project.

\paragraph{Streaming information} such as video or audio feeds from an agent to a user would currently have to be done through the API, transferring the information to the server as a string.
This entails significant overhead, and the possibility of establishing a direct streaming link between agents and users or expanding the API somehow could be explored.

\paragraph{Analyze communication overhead} due to the application being layered on top of HTTP and transmitting information as JSON.

\paragraph{Examine latency bounds} on different kinds of networks.

\paragraph{Implementing the agent} consumed a considerable amount of the development time.
Could the process of designing and implementing an agent for a generic robot or device be simplified?

\paragraph{Communication fail-safes.}
What should happen when the controller is disconnected or the robot loses its connection while executing a command?

\paragraph{Multi-user control} is possible and there is no limit to how many users that can send control signals to a connected device.
What possible issues could arise from two or more users attempting to control a device concurrently?
How could this be prevented?

\paragraph{Security} has been discussed, but are there other security related concerns with such a service?
