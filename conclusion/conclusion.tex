\chapter{Conclusion}
There should be some, like, text here.
Probably.
Summarizing what we got done and what kind of future work exists.
Like "recommended avenues for future research."
Oooh we should mention that the system can be used as the basis for a web service (like github) or on a local network to allow the remote control of devices on it (but not from the outside, like idk maybe a company would want to do this).
The great thing is that once you've written the agent-client and user-client you can re-use these on other platforms.
