\chapter{Concluding remarks}
\section{Conclusion}
There should be some, like, text here.
Probably.
Summarizing what we got done and what kind of future work exists.
Like "recommended avenues for future research."
Oooh we should mention that the system can be used as the basis for a web service (like github) or on a local network to allow the remote control of devices on it (but not from the outside, like idk maybe a company would want to do this).
The great thing is that once you've written the agent-client and user-client you can re-use these on other platforms.


This paper has presented a simple approach to making a very general and scaleable system for communication trough the internet.
It can be implemented with various degrees of security layers, depending on the use case.
The system can just as easily be implemented on a local network, allowing control with total separation from the outside. 
We have shown a working implementation of the system, where we used it to control a robot.

\section{Future work}

Direct connections for real time communication like video and driving
