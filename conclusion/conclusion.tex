\section{Conclusion}
This report has presented an approach to making a general and scalable system for communicating remote control signals through the internet.
It can be implemented with variable degree of security layers depending on the use case.
The system can just as easily be implemented on a local network, allowing control with total separation from the outside. 
It is also possible to implement the system as a web-service, allowing people on the internet to remote control their own and others' devices.
We have shown a working implementation of the system, where we used it to control a robot with four wheels and a three jointed arm.
