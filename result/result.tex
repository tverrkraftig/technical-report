\chapter{Results}
We should have like, a graph or drawing of the finished system here shouldn't with the involved components and actors and what gets transferred between them.
Like those drawings Anders have been keeping safe in his lockerbox or whatever.


The project was initially split into three parts. These were ``server'',``agent(robot)'' and ``server-agent communication''. 
At the concluding phase of the project, these three part were combined to form the whole system.
The planning work done early proved to be very good, as the finishing phase went surprisingly smooth. 
The server part was augmented with a graphical user interface, which can be used from any web browser. 
It can be accessed by both smartphones and computer, and from anywhere in the world. 
The robot's wheels and arm was successfully controlled via this interface. 
The latency was tolerable for controlling the vehicle, but the system can in no way guarantee real time performance.
The worst case agent-server latency is too high for this.
The robot's error handling worked well, as its behavior was as intended when we introduced various error conditions.
