As described above the project has a relatively high degree of innovation. 
This means that there are no similar systems which are based on the same simple principles as this project. 
This may be a result of manufacturers often tends to overcomplicate things. 
Its weaknesses are not significant as they can be fixed with a small amount of invested time. 
The one thing really standing in the way of this project is the end of EiT, and the fact that the group is being dissolved.
