\chapter{SWOT}
SWOT analysis is one of the most commonly used marketing strategies. 
The analysis identifies strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses and threats~\cite{swot-ref}.
It's also important to use the information gathered in the SWOT analysis in the formation of project objectives and long term goals. 
The following SWOT analysis will be brief.

\textbf{\Large Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
	 \item Everything is built on already existing technologies
	 \item The system is modular, which means easily expandable
	 \item Relatively cheap hardware and free software
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\Large Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
	 \item Latency caused by HTTP limitations
	 \item Limited to the dynamixel servos (possible to support more manufacturers)
	 \item No team to take the project further
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\Large Opportunities}
\begin{itemize}
	 \item No universal platform (that we could find) exists
	 \item Many different solutions have been tried, but no module based and easy to develop
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\Large Threats}
\begin{itemize}
	 \item Existing technologies doesn't allow easy expansion, but there are many good solutions for different specific tasks
	 \item Marketing problems 
     \item End of EiT
\end{itemize}

As described above the project has a relatively high degree of innovation. 
What this means is that there are no similar systems based on the same principles as this project.
This may be because of manufacturers' tendency to needlessly over-complicate things.
Its weaknesses are not significant: They do not make the project impossible to execute.
The one thing really standing in the way of this project is the end of EiT, and the fact that the group is being dissolved.
At that time the project will most likely go the way of most course-enforced student projects: relegated to a github project page and as an example for future students.
