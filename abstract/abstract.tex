\chapter{Abstract}
This paper presents our technical project for the subject TMM4850, ``Instrumentation and control over the Internet''.
The subject is a part of the NTNU course ``Experts in Team'', where students from different academic backgrounds join together in a semester-long technical project.
We developed a secure, efficient and scalable system for sending data and commands between various nodes. 
To demonstrate the system, we built a robot which we controlled trough a server using a web user interface.
The system proved to be effective and reliable, and a good platform for further expansion and development.
